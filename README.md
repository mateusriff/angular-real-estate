# Angular Real Estate

This project was made following the ["Your First App" Tutorial](https://angular.io/tutorial/first-app) from Angular docs. It implements routing, services, directives, forms and 
asynchronous HTTP communication. 

## Run this app

Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies. Start the mock REST API by running `json-server --watch db.json`. Then, on another terminal, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` on your browser and the app will be there.

### Requirements

Before starting the development server, make sure you have [`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) installed globally. You also need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), first and foremost.
